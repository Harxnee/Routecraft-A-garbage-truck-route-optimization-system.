## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Generates optimal routes for garbage trucks based on various parameters such as distance, traffic conditions, and waste collection points.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilizes geospatial data to plan and adjust routes dynamically.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for inputting data and viewing optimized routes.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Allows for real-time route adjustments based on live traffic updates and other factors.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Aims to reduce operational costs and fuel consumption.
